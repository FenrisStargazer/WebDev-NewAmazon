            <p>
                   I’m Jeffrey Bezos, but everyone just calls me Jeff. I was born to a couple of 
                   teenagers in Albuquerque, NM, way back in 1964 (yeah I’m almost 60, hence the 
                   polished hairdo). Though I mostly grew up in Houston and later Miami. I graduated 
                   summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1986, with a Bachelor’s in engineering. 
                   While there I was able to participate in not one but two “prestigious” fraternities, 
                   Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi. This was mostly all thanks to the copious amounts of 
                   money my adoptive step-father made.
            </p>
            <p>
                  It was during the boring beginning part of my career working in telecommunications and 
                  banking of all things, that I met my wife of 26-ish years, a novelist and philanthropist 
                  originally from San Francisco, CA. She is the mother to my three sons and adopted daughter, 
                  though we recently divorced in 2019 after I cheated on her with some random news anchor/TV personality.

            <p>
              The other person who’s had a sizeable effect on my life would be my biggest rival, Elon Musk. 
              He’s the second richest man alive and as weird and incomprehensible as I am morally reprehensible. 
              Though several billionaires are partaking in this “Space Race: Round II”, Musk and I are practically 
              the rivaling superpowers of that group. Though he’s a fool if he thinks he’ll ever beat me.
            </p>
            <p>
              He’s only moderately more popular than I am because he makes a fool of himself all over the internet 
              whereas I have some semblance of dignity and an image to maintain. But even those who don’t know me 
              undoubtedly know my company, which is probably more than he could say.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also at least I don’t use my children as a media ploy, and didn’t give them nonsensical names that 
              are going to be remembered and get them laughed at for the rest of their lives.

                    <p>
                      Like most billionaires, I don’t do much anymore besides spend all this freaking money 
                      I’ve accumulated from my widely successful and pretty much globally famous company Amazon. 
                      I go to a lot of board meetings and a lot of famous-people parties, mostly to flaunt my power 
                      and wealth to the world and the underlings that make my success possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Back in the beginning though, I did work really hard getting Amazon off the ground, originally 
                      as an online book store. Alongside my now ex-wife, I spent many, many hours in a dirty, rented 
                      garage in Seattle, WA, running things day-to-day and building up the business. Although this was 
                      hardly any sort of rags to riches story, as I had already had about a decade of working profitable 
                      computer engineering jobs for decently big companies. And as mentioned before, my family was far 
                      from poor at this point.

                      Around the year 2000, I started Blue Origin, a “human spaceflight startup”. While 
                      Amazon was my cash cow, Blue Origin was my baby, my passion. I even made my senior 
                      graduation speech about how badly I wanted to be the one to get humans out into the 
                      solar system and turn Earth into some giant nature preserve. Because I really care 
                      deeply about the Earth’s natural resources (despite exploiting them frequently to cut 
                      costs and carelessly testing rockets with reckless abandon, ignoring the extreme 
                      pollution that it contributes...)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Though it wasn’t until 2006 that Blue Origin was even really recognized or acknowledged 
                      by the public. And not until around 2015 that it had any marketable success. But finally 
                      around 2021, it launched it’s first successful sub-orbital flight with passengers, 
                      including myself, my half-brother and some other quasi-important people.

                      In 2013, when I got bored of being a billionaire running a worldwide megacorp, 
                      I decided to buy out The Washington Post for several million dollars (using some 
                      sketchy front company kind of tactics that honestly really scream dodging monopoly 
                      law or tax evasion but y’know whatever). There I successfully turned around the 
                      business and reinvigorated the target audience, boosting numbers to all time highs 
                      and bringing the first major profits the company had seen in years.

                      Though of course, as with buying any large communication outlet, there are the 
                      numerous allegations that I enforce some kind of censorship or control over what’s 
                      written and released within the paper. Which I can firmly assure is obviously false. 
                      Why should I care what they write about? I have enough money to fix just about any 
                      consequences I don’t like. And it’s not like the thoughts of the underpaid masses 
                      really affects me at all.

                      And last, but certainly not least, I have recently co-founded Altos Labs in 2021-2022. 
                      A biotech company aimed at finding ways of anti-aging (aka “longevity therapeutics”) 
                      through “cellular reprogramming”, with a top notch array of scientists from all walks 
                      of life who specialize in this bizarre little niche of genetic/cellular engineering. 
                      In part so that I can sell this tech to tyrannical rich people for disgusting amounts 
                      of money and become the world’s first trillionaire. But also so that I might keep myself 
                      from dying of old age, or from dying nearly so soon. In this way I can continue pursuing 
                      my dreams of colonizing the solar system and continue exploiting millions of workers 
                      worldwide on a daily basis, long after my time is through.
